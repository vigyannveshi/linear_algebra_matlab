# **Linear Algebra (MATLAB)**

### Linear algebra is an essential tool before mastering MATLAB, as we move on using MATLAB, without basics of linear algebra like declaring vectors, matrices, transpose, normalization, eigen values, plotting, so on and so forth it is slightly difficult to understand other applications.
## **Possible Roadmap**
### 1) Learn overview of entire software, this helps you to understand the   application of the software.

### 2) Learnt basics of linear algebra, this helped me to realise the practical use of matrices. Specifically the use of Singular Value Decomposition to reduce the file size of an image and the importance of rank of the matrix.
